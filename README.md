## Summary

A simple GTK frontend to
[HeadsetControl](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl).  That
program must be installed and available in your $PATH for this
frontend to function.

Upon startup, the program queries the headset for its name and
capabilities, and constructs a graphical user interface managing the
controls it was able to find.

Since I have a Logitech G 533, only the capabilities of that headset
have been fully explored.
